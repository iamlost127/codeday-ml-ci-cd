# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning

**What is CI/CD**

***Continuous Integration*** is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, 
usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. 
Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors 
as quickly as possible. This approach leads to significantly reduced 
integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly*

***Continuous Delivery*** is a software development discipline where you build software 
in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.*

The key test is that a *business sponsor could request that the current development version of the 
software can be deployed into production at a moment's notice* - and nobody would bat an eyelid, let alone panic.
